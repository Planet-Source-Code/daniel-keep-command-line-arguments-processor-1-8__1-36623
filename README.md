## Command\-Line Arguments Processor \(1\.8\)


</div>

### Description

This is just a little module I threw together... must've been over three years ago. I've used it in nearly all my applications since. It basically takes the application's Command$ string, and turns it into a C/C++ style array of arguments. This is invaluable when writing apps that need to take arguments from the command line. It also has an added method IsSwitch() to find switches in your arguments (like /l, /swap or even complex ones that use pattern matching!)

D/L it and give it a try. -- Update 1.6b --: Well, I should've updated this earlier, but oh well. Fixes a problem with IsSwitch(), and re-introduces GetArgs()! GetArgs() is the original method, and allows you to specify not only a custom command-line, but also which arrays you want it to be processed into. -- Update 1.8 --: Ok, this is a pretty big update. It changes the naming scheme of the methods, adds a few, and removes one or two that weren't related. See the top comment for more info. Enjoy, and Merry Christmas!
